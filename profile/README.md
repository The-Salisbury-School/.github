Development Flow
================

*   create a branch, name it `feature-name`
    *   commit often
*   when finished, create a pull request
    *   if changes requested, review comments and fix.
    *   commit often
*   when finished, create a pull request
    *   if approved, it will be merged into `main`
*   With your code merged, main will be entirely up-to-date and published. You can safely delete your old branch. To continue developing, create a new branch and repeat the process.
